#### To extract the relevant numbers from correlators:
# the the correlator file need to be named like
"corr.m${mu}_b${beta}_L${L}T${T}_k${kappa}_${phase(low/high)}"
# To choose which correlator file to extract write their names in the file templist
(e.g:# ls $datadir > table_corr ) then
./get_corr
# input: table_corr, corr.*
# output: table_run.dat, corr.*.dat

#### To extract the basic quantities: m_pi, f_pi, g_pi, omegas, Z's ...
# edit file get_Q to select the ranges.
# from matlab
get_Q
# input: table_run.dat, table_Q.saved, corr.*.dat
# output: table_Q.temp

#### To extract the LEC's
# edit file get_LEC to choose the fitting setup
# from matlab
get_LEC('b')

#input: table_Q.? 
#output: plots and LEC on matlab
